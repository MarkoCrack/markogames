    <h2>The end</h2>
    <p style="width: 600px;">
        Today I'm updating PH for the last time and archiving the project for several reasons. Unfortunately it's not something that I enjoy working on anymore. 
        It was exciting to develop it was just gaining traction, but eventually the high wore off and I was left to cope with the fact that my most popular work
        was something that I wasn't proud of, technically or morally. The site was something that I put together in a few hours, and I hadn't expected it to be
        something I'd have to maintain, and I struggled to justify working on a games site that enabled procrastination and some bad choices.
        <br>
        As I approach a turning point in my life I want to focus on doing more good, and PLAYHYDRA just doesn't fit that vision.
        <br>
        So, the site will stay up indefinitely but don't be surprised it it falls to disrepair.
        <br>
        Thank you so much for all the emails (I apologize to everyone who I couldn't respond to), for the support, and for proving to me that I can create things that people care about.
        <br>
        <br>
        It's been a pleasure,
        <br>
        Liam
